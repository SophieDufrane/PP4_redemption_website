### Forking and Cloning the Project

Forking the repository creates a copy of this project, allowing modifications without affecting the original code. Once the repository is forked, it can be cloned to a local machine for development. Follow these steps to fork, clone, and work on the project:

- **Fork the repository**
  - Go to the repository you want to fork on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
  - In the top-right corner of the page, click `Fork`.
  - Name the new forked repository, then click `Create Fork`.
  - This creates a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

Once the repository is forked, we need to clone it to our local machine before working on it. This is done by following the steps below:

- **Clone the forked repository**
  - In the forked repository on GitHub, above the list of files, click `Code`.
  - Copy the URL for the repository (either HTTPS or SSH).
  - Open a terminal (or Git Bash).
  - Type `git clone`, then paste the copied URL.
  - Press `Enter`
  - Navigate to the newly cloned repository directory: `cd` and the repository name.

### External Libraries, Tools and Technology

- `Python`: The main programming language used for building the survey and analysis tool.
- `Gitpod`: A cloud-based IDE used for developing the project.
